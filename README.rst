DEPRECATION NOTICE
------------------

This project was a hobby project for a very old version of VortexBox, and has not been maintained for some time.  The original app was removed from the Chrome Web Store on 2014-11-17 for misusing keywords.  I have moved on from the VortexBox project since 2013.

If you'd like to fork this project, get it working with the current version of VortexBox and reupload it to CWS, you are entirely free to do so :-)


VortexBox (Chrome) v0.7 May 9, 2012 divreg <wyatt.brege@gmail.com>

<https://github.com/divreg/VortexBox-Chrome-App>

This is an unofficial Chrome app for VortexBox. 

I made this app for fun, and I hope you have fun using it and modifying it.  The app is available in the Google Chrome Web Store.  See https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hinhjflaolfeelmjmnhfagdbcelnogem for details.
